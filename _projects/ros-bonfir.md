excerpt: A game that is similar to the classic game Jetpac, but based on the Annual RHIT Homecoming Bonfire tradition. 
description: |
    ***Rōs Bonfīr***, is based loosely on the classic ‘80s shooter ***Jetpac***. In the twilight hours, mere minutes before the annual Rose-Hulman Homecoming Celebration commences, a rogue agent has commandeered a fleet of drones and used them to tear apart the completed bonfire assembly. Our fearless hero, ***Rosie the Elephant***, dons her jetpack and attempts to reassemble the pieces amid an onslaught of drones whose only goal is to ruin Homecoming! Once rebuilt, Rosie adds fuel to the bonfire, lights it, and saves the day!

    <u>Gameplay</u>: The player moves Rosie around a game level which consists of multiple stationary platforms, each of which is positioned above the ground (a large flat platform). Initially, sections of the bonfire assembly are distributed across these platforms. Rosie must avoid enemy drones and assemble the sections in the correct order. Once complete, Rosie must fly around and collect items to activate the bonfire (fuel to act as an accelerant). With the jetpack, Rosie can fly up, and the jetpack constantly propels her up. The player turns the jetpack on and off to control Rosie's altitude.
